# Getting Started with Weather Forecast App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling. This app is a tool for viewing the weather in your city (or anywhere, actually) utilising the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and [Auth0 SPA GitHub Social login](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login).
